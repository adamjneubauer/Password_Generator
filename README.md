### Password_Generator

### Description 

This goal of this project was to create a functioning web page that creates a password for the user based on the criteria that the user requires. When the webpage is opened the user is asked how many characters they would like to have in their password and whether or not the password should contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers. The "generate password" button should generate a password once clicked that meets the criteria put forth.
